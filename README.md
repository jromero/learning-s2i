# Learning s2i

This repo serves the sole purpose of collecting information and resource _I_ used when learning about s2i.

## Tutorials

I've posted a few tutorials based on what I learned on dev.to.

1. [Build an app image with s2i](https://dev.to/jromero/building-an-app-image-using-s2i-5gcp)
1. [Creating an s2i builder for Go (and a runtime image)](https://dev.to/jromero/creating-an-s2i-builder-for-go-and-a-runtime-image-5d56)
